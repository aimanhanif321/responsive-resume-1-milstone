Responsive Resume Website
The Responsive Resume project is a dynamic, interactive resume created using HTML, CSS, and typeScript. The primary focus of this project is to provide a user-friendly, mobile-first resume layout that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

Key Features:
Responsive Design:

The resume layout is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on any device, whether it's a large desktop monitor or a small smartphone screen.
Utilizes CSS Flexbox/Grid and media queries to adapt the layout based on screen width, hiding or showing elements and adjusting font sizes for optimal readability.
Structured Information:

The resume is broken down into clearly defined sections, such as:
Personal Information (Name, Contact, Profile Picture)
Professional Summary
Skills
Work Experience
Education
Projects
Certifications
Each section is styled to maintain a professional look and feel, making it easy for potential employers to read.
